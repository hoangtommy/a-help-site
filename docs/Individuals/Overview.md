# Overview

Individuals, including married couples or domestic partners, have a set of standards they need to meet in order to be designated as an accredited investor by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Note: Individuals encompass natural person and/or their spouse or domestic partner.

## Individual Standards

Below are the common standards for individuals. Investors do not need to meet all of them, but rather only one of them.

- Income
- Net Worth
- Financial Professional

Again, note that these standards can be met as a single natural person, or jointly between two natural persons who are domestic or married partners.

You can view these standards directly on the United States Securities and Exchange Commission website at: https://www.sec.gov/resources-small-businesses/capital-raising-building-blocks/accredited-investor
