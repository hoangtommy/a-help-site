# Net Worth Standard

Another common criteria to qualify as an accredited investor is through the net worth standard.

### Understanding the Net Worth Standard

To meet the [SEC’s net worth standard](https://www.sec.gov/education/capitalraising/building-blocks/accredited-investor) for accredited investors, individuals must satisfy **_both_** of the following conditions:

1. **Individual Net Worth**: The individual must have a net worth, or joint net worth with their spouse or domestic partner, exceeding $1 million at the time of the investment.
   
2. **Exclusion of Primary Residence**: The value of the individual’s primary residence must be excluded from the net worth calculation. Any mortgage debt on the primary residence that exceeds its value must be included as a liability in the net worth calculation.[*](#detailed-criteria)

### Detailed Criteria
Net worth is calculated by subtracting an individual(s)' liabilities from their assets. Net Worth = Assets - Liabilities.

1. **Net Worth exceeding $1 Million**:
   - Net worth can include assets such as cash, stocks, bonds, real estate (excluding primary residence), private securities, loans, and other investments.
   - Liabilities include debts such as credit card balances, car loans, real estate loans, and primary mortgage debt exceeding the value of the primary residence.
   - The net worth threshold must be met individually or jointly with a spouse or domestic partner.

2. **Exclusion of Primary Residence**:
   - The primary residence’s value is excluded from the asset side of the net worth calculation. This is defined explicitly by the SEC.
   - If the fair market value on the primary residence exceeds its mortgage balance, the loan may be omitted from the liabilities side of the net worth calculation.

   
    :::tip Excluding Primary Residence Debt
    Net Worth calculation example when excluding primary residence mortgage:

    - Assets: $1.2M
    - Regulat Debts: $100k
    - Primary Resident Mortgage: $300k _excluded because the home has equity_
    - Net Worth = $1.1M ($1.2M - $100k)

    _Note:_ The primary residence's value must exceed its mortgage balance.

### Documenting Net Worth

Investors should be prepared to provide documentation to verify their net worth. Acceptable documentation includes:

- Recent bank statements
- Brokerage account statements
- Property appraisals (excluding primary residence)
- Mortgage statements
- Statements of other assets (e.g., ownership of businesses)
- Proof of liabilities (e.g., credit card statements, car loan statements)
- Financial statements prepared by an accountant

#### Including a Credit Report

A credit report is also a valuable document when verifying net worth. It provides a comprehensive overview of an individual's outstanding debts and liabilities. The credit report is crucial for the following reasons:

- **Verification of Liabilities**: It helps in confirming the accuracy of declared liabilities such as credit card debt, personal loans, and other financial obligations.
- **Assessment of Financial Health**: A credit report provides insight into the individual's overall financial health and responsibility in managing debts.

By including a credit report in the documentation, investors ensure a more accurate and transparent calculation of their net worth, aligning with SEC requirements.

This verification process ensures compliance with SEC regulations and safeguards against potential legal issues.

### Conclusion

Meeting the SEC's net worth standard is a clear path for individual investors and their domestic partners or spouses to qualify as accredited investors. By maintaining a net worth exceeding $1 million, excluding the value of the primary residence, investors can access exclusive investment opportunities that offer potentially higher returns.

For more detailed information and guidance, consult with a financial advisor or legal professional to ensure compliance with all SEC regulations and make the most of your investment potential.
