# Income Standard

One of the primary ways for individuals to qualify as an accredited investor is through the income standard, [as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)](https://www.sec.gov/education/capitalraising/building-blocks/accredited-investor). 

### Understanding the Income Standard

To meet the [SECâ€™s income standard](https://www.sec.gov/education/capitalraising/building-blocks/accredited-investor), individuals must satisfy one of the following conditions:

1. **Individual Income**: The individual must have earned an annual income of at least $200,000 in each of the two most recent years. 

2. **Joint Income**: The individual and their spouse or domestic partner must have earned a combined annual income of at least $300,000 in each of the two most recent years.

The income can include salary, bonuses, commissions, pension, and other earnings. In both cases, the individual(s) must have a reasonable expectation of reaching the same income level in the current year.

### Documenting Income

Investors should provide documents to verify their income. Acceptable documentation includes:

- Tax returns
- Form 1040
- Form 8879
- W-2 forms
- Form 1099
- K-1 forms
- Pay stubs
- Statements by an accountant or attorney

This verification process ensures compliance with SEC regulations and safeguards the investor and their issuer against potential legal issues.

### Investor FAQs

1. **I made more than $200,000 in each of the last two years, and my spouse made $50,000 in that same period. Are we both considered accredited investors?**:
   - You would be considered an individual accredited investor, but your spouse would not because your joint income did not exceed $300,000 in each of the two previous years. The issuer would only be able to accept you as an investor under Regulation D, Rule 506(c). 

2. **I made less than $200,000, but my partner makes more than $300,000 in each of the last two years and expects to do so for the foreseeable future. Am I an accredited investor?**:
   - Both your partner and you are considered accredited investor if

### Conclusion

Meeting the SEC's income standard is a straightforward way for individual investors and their spouses or spousesal equivalents to qualify as accredited investors. By maintaining an individual income of $200,000 or a joint income of $300,000, and having a reasonable expectation of continuing to earn at that level, investors can access private investment opportunities such as 506(c) offerings.
