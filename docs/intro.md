# Investor Accreditations

Let's get your accreditation status **verified**!


### Why you need to get verified

You're likely investing in a private security (or offering) and your issuer (or sponsor) told you this was a requirement. They're right. All investors purchasing shares in private offering under Regulation D, Rule 506(c) need to prove that they have the financial means and the sophistication to make the investment under the guidelines of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.

Your sponsor is taking the required steps in verifying your financial standing which is a good signal. 

### What you'll need

- Decide whether you'll be investing as an individual or through an entity
- Determine which accreditation standard you qualify for
- Gather relevant financial documents as proof
- Submit your evidence for review to your issuer or their 3rd-party verifier
- Receive confirmation and move forward with your investment
